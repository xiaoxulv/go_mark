Next week we begin three sessions on "Intelligence". As mentioned in class, we have provided a new interface for viewing the recorded lecture materials, called the Virtual Teaching Assistant. In order to encourage as many students as possible to try the VTA, we are offering extra credit to each student who complete the set of VTA materials for "Intelligence" - each student completing this topic will receive extra credit in the form of full marks for three quizzes (which can be used to replace your three worst/missed quiz scores).
